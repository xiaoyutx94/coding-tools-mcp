# CI And Test Commands

This repository uses a local compliance runner plus GitHub Actions.

## One-Command Gates

```bash
make compliance
make ci
```

`make compliance` runs the full compliance suite and writes `reports/compliance/latest.json` and `reports/compliance/latest.md`.

`make ci` mirrors the main CI workflow: lint, typecheck, unittest discovery, protocol tests, integration/security tests, required docs checks, schema drift checks, dogfood smoke, and SWE-bench smoke preflight.

Report files are overwritten by whichever suite or benchmark was run most recently. Check `suite` in compliance reports and `conclusion` in benchmark reports before citing them.

## PyPI Release

Publish through the release helper so the same build, check, upload, and install-verification flow is used every time:

```bash
make publish-testpypi
make publish-pypi
```

`make publish-testpypi` uploads to TestPyPI only. `make publish-pypi` uploads to production PyPI and asks for an irreversible-release confirmation. To run both in sequence:

```bash
make publish-all
```

The helper expects `TWINE_USERNAME`/`TWINE_PASSWORD` or `~/.pypirc` credentials. For token auth, use `__token__` as the username. After a production upload, bump `[project].version` and `coding_tools_mcp.__version__` before the next release because PyPI files cannot be overwritten.

## Individual Gates

```bash
make test-mcp-contract
make test-tool-golden
make test-security
make test-e2e
make test-runtime-semantics
make test-docs-required
make test-schema-drift
make dogfood-mcp
make dogfood-runner
make dogfood-smoke
make benchmark-smoke
make benchmark-real-workloads
```

| Command | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `make test-mcp-contract` | MCP initialize, `tools/list`, schemas, annotations, structured success/error envelopes, protocol errors |
| `make test-tool-golden` | Golden behavior for read/list/search/patch/exec/stdin/kill/git/image paths |
| `make test-security` | Traversal, symlink escape, command workdir escape, risky env, shell-expansion gating, Linux Landlock fallback behavior, direct syscall denial where Landlock is available, timeout/watchdog, buffer caps |
| `make test-e2e` | End-to-end coding loops through the runtime |
| `make test-runtime-semantics` | Patch/session/image behavior vectors |
| `make test-docs-required` | Required docs, evidence artifacts, and CI workflow gate checks |
| `make test-schema-drift` | Live tool schema/annotation names compared against the checked-in runtime contract/docs |
| `make dogfood-mcp` | Unittest MCP-only dogfood cases |
| `make dogfood-runner` | Full deterministic HTTP dogfood transcript and report |
| `make dogfood-smoke` | Both dogfood suites |
| `make benchmark-smoke` | SWE-bench smoke preflight and placeholder prediction validation |
| `make benchmark-real-workloads` | MCP runtime smoke over real Python, Node, Rust, Go, and monorepo checkouts plus large file/output and long command cases |

Valid runner suites include `all`, `mcp-contract`, `tool-golden`, `security`, `e2e`, `runtime-semantics`, `dogfood`, `compliance-report`, `docs-required`, and `schema-drift`.

## GitHub Actions

Main workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/compliance.yml
```

The main workflow also includes a `windows-msvc-smoke` job. It verifies that
Windows reports unsupported TTY requests explicitly, force-kills a background
session without relying on POSIX `SIGKILL`, initializes Visual Studio with
`vcvarsall.bat x64`, checks the narrow default `core` environment, and confirms
that `--shell-env-inherit all` can compile and run a single-file `cl.exe` smoke.

Manual SWE-bench workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/swebench-lite.yml
```

The manual `swebench-lite` workflow can install the official harness, record Docker diagnostics, run selected Lite instance IDs, and upload `reports/benchmark/**`. It defaults to `prediction_source=reference_patch`, which generates non-empty SWE-bench reference-patch predictions for official harness sanity. It fails by default unless official harness results include parsed resolved counts with `candidate_mcp_resolved >= baseline_native_resolved`. Use `prediction_source=checked_in` only after replacing the scaffold files with model-generated predictions.

Manual real-workload workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/real-workloads.yml
```

The manual `real-workloads` workflow installs Python, Node, Go, and Rust toolchains, runs `make benchmark-real-workloads`, and uploads `reports/benchmark/real-workloads**`.

Docker workflows:

```text
.github/workflows/docker-image.yml
.github/workflows/docker-smoke.yml
```

`docker-image` builds and publishes the sandbox image to GHCR. `docker-smoke` builds the image, starts `coding-tools-mcp --permission-mode trusted` in a container, verifies MCP metadata and `tools/list`, checks `server_info`, and runs explicit `exec_command` toolchain version commands.
